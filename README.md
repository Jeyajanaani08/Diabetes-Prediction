# Diabetes-Prediction
**Abstract**
**About:** This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health metrics.
**Description of Model:** This project involves developing a web application where users can input their health data, including metrics like blood pressure, glucose levels, and Body Mass Index (BMI). The app will leverage machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and decision tree, to predict the user's risk of diabetes. The backend is built using Django, while Scikit-learn provides the tools for building and training the ML models. The application aims to provide users with a valuable health assessment tool, empowering them to take proactive measures in managing their health. Through user-friendly interfaces and robust predictive analytics, this app integrates technology and healthcare to deliver personalized risk assessments seamlessly.
**Diabetes:** Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood. It occurs when the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it produces.
